# PHASE 1: ideation away from existing content

Attached are story summaries for SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." 

Review the summaries and come up with some directions for new science areas that have not been covered yet for this week's research.

# PHASE 2 (continuation): ideation, research and story outline

Choose three of these to do some deep research and generate a new story outline.

# PHASE 3: (new thread) selection and writing. (attach story outlines from above, and prior summaries)

Review each of the story outlines and critically analyse them for their similarity to the existing story summaries. Your task is to:
-- select the most compelling story idea, based on its novelty from existing story lines
-- edit the story (characters, locations, ideas) to rigorously ensure there are near zero similarities to existing summaries.
-- draft a version 1 of the full story.

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." Ensure your story is distinct from the characters and themes of recent stories on the site.

It is key that your story is founded on real scientific breakthroughs. If you need to do some research to re-acquaint yourself with the latest related findings. Do this.
