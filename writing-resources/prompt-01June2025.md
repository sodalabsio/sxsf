# PHASE 1: ideation away from existing content

Attached are story summaries for SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." 

Review the summaries and come up with [
    some directions for new science areas that have not been covered yet for this week's research.

[
    with three possible story ideas based around the attached summary research article, with science article: [[Bulkâ€“spatiotemporal vortex correspondence in gyromagnetic zero-index media (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08948-6) . ]]

    It is essential that your story ideas break new ground/territory and put an emphasis on novelty and creativity.

# PHASE 2 (continuation): ideation, research and story outline

Review each of the story outlines and critically analyse them for their similarity to the existing story summaries. Your task is to:

-- select the most compelling story idea, based on its novelty from existing story lines

-- edit the story (characters, locations, ideas) to rigorously ensure there are near zero similarities to existing summaries.

-- draft a version 1 of the full story.

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." Ensure your story is distinct from the characters and themes of recent stories on the site.

It is key that your story is founded on real scientific breakthroughs. If you need to do some research to re-acquaint yourself with the latest related findings. Do this.

# PHASE 2b: write to template

Perfect, use the story template to prepare the story for deployment. You will need to select up to 5 significant scientific papers from your research to link to in the template. Be sure to include the URLs as indicated in the template.

# PHASE 3: (new thread) selection and writing. (attach story outlines from above, and prior summaries)

Critically review the new story attached for its similarity (any kind of similarity) to existing stories as summarised in the second attch.

Re-write/edit the story as appropriate to ensure it is truly novel (themes, characters, settings). Be sure it has a compelling, thought-provoking twist!
