Build a react app that I can deploy to github pages that will host a weekly series of AI generated Sci-Fi stories. Each story is created around a breakthrough in science from the week's news, and contains the story (in markdown), an AI generated lead image (png) and a collection of around 5 links with some context to key science papers/articles that support the science behind the story. The idea is that the website will be a resource for teachers, students and science loving public to try and get them to engage more with science, through the hook of an engaging weekly short story. So clean, elegant, design is important. I also want to highlight the 'curren't (latest) story, but also make it easy for visitors to be drawn into reading other stories. So for example, a front page with cards for multiple stories, and perhaps on a given story, a 'read next' area for linking to other stories would be good. The page should have an 'About' tab so that I can clearly let the user know this is AI generated content, and the 'why' of the site. I've attached an example story for you to look at. My thinking is that I can take the markdown and add it each week using vs code to the stories folder (say) of the app's data, push/deploy, and know that the new story will now be platformed by the site.
