Use Agent-C to write a creative and compelling short sci-fi story (about 2000 words).

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." Ensure your story is distinct from the characters and themes of recent stories on the site.
