Write a creative and compelling short sci-fi story (about 2000 words).

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." Ensure your story is distinct from the characters and themes of recent stories on the site.

Today's story should relate to the finding of [ .... ] 

I have also provided a summary of the current stories on the website -- be sure that your story is as different as possible from the existing stories (eg. characters, plot lines, etc.).

Do some preliminary science research. Then develop a compelling story inspired by the science. The story should be set in 2025, i.e. human technology should be current. Ensure you have a thought provoking twist in the tail!

You should carry out the following steps:

1. Research - research the science behind the finding (can be in parallel)

2. Ideation - create three candidate story ideas, along with variations for thought-provoking twists in the ending

3. Selection - select the candidate best story idea, judged on the basis of scientific grounding, creativity, and originality (as judged by difference to the existing SXSF stories)

4. Refinement - refine the selected story idea, including character development, plot structure, and setting, again ensuring originality from the existing SXSF stories

5. Writing - write the story, ensuring it is compelling and engaging, with a strong narrative arc and character development

6. Review and Edit - review the story for interest, originality, and scientific grounding, make changes as appropriate

7. Finalise - write out the story, with references, following the story-template.ts template provided
