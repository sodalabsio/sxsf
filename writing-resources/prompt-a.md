# PHASE 1: Research and Ideation

Your task is to write an outline for a creative and compelling short sci-fi story (about 2000 words).

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." Ensure your story is distinct from the characters and themes of recent stories on the site.

Today's story should relate to the finding of [ .... ] 

I have also provided a summary of the current stories on the website -- be sure that your story is as different as possible from the existing stories (eg. characters, plot lines, etc.).

Do some preliminary science research. Then develop a compelling detailed story outline inspired by the science. The story should be set in 2025, i.e. human technology should be current. Ensure you have a thought provoking twist in the tail!

You should carry out the following steps:

1. Research - research the science behind the finding (can be in parallel)

2. Ideation - create three candidate story ideas, along with variations for thought-provoking twists in the ending

3. Selection - select the candidate best story idea, judged on the basis of scientific grounding, creativity, and originality (as judged by difference to the existing SXSF stories)

4. Refinement - refine the selected story idea, including character development, plot structure, and setting, again ensuring originality from the existing SXSF stories

Your output should be in md format and include:
 - The final the story outline
 - 5 supporting references (with URLs), including a brief description of the reference and how it relates to the story


# PHASE 2: Writing, review and finalisation

Your task is to write a creative and compelling short sci-fi story (about 2000 words) based on the detailed outline provided in the attached markdown file.

You are writing for the website SXSF (Science X Sci-Fi)(https://sodalabsio.github.io/sxsf/). The byline of the site is "Weekly AI-generated Sci-Fi stories by researchers at Monash University inspired by the latest scientific breakthroughs. Where imagination meets real science." 

You are to follow the steps below, and focus on making the story as engaging and compelling as possible with strong characters, settings and pacing; a real page-turner!

1. Writing - write the story following the outline provided, ensuring it is compelling and engaging, with a strong narrative arc and character development.

2. Review and Edit - review the story for interest, originality, and scientific grounding, make changes as appropriate, especially if you judge that any aspect of the story is too similar to existing SXSF stories. (refer to summaries provided).

3. Finalise - write out the story, with references, following the story-template.ts template provided.
